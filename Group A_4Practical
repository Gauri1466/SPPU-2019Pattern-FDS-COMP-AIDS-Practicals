'''Write a Python program that computes the net amount of a bank account based a 
transaction log from console input. The transaction log format is shown as following: D 
100 W 200 (Withdrawal is not allowed if balance is going negative. Write functions for 
withdraw and deposit) D means deposit while W means withdrawal. 
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:  
D 300, D 300 ,  W 200, D 100 Then, the output should be: 500 '''
